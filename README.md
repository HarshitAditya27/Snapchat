## Introduction 🐱‍💻
Created a Snapchat Story feature clone using React. It's function is similar as WhatsApp/Instagram Story feature. I have used redux and Firebase for authentication and hosting. Building this clone was very challenging as Redux and Firebase just got upgraded at the time of bulding this clone. Learned a lot of new Redux syntax while building the clone.
